## QUESTION 1

Run the following chunk (for this class you're not required to know what it does, but we added comments so that you can understand it, if you are interested).

```{r}
#| message: false
# Loading libraries 
library(openintro) # For the dataset
library(tidyverse) # For ggplot, count() and summarize()

# Removing NA values (some functions like summarize() return NA by default if you input a vector with NA values)
email <-
  email %>% 
  drop_na()

# Setting to 10 the number of decimals returned
options(digits=10)

# Replacing the dataset with a subset that includes only the variables that we are interested in
email <- email %>%
  select(spam, to_multiple, sent_email, dollar, num_char)

# Transforming the binary variables to factors: it will make easier to use them in plots

email <- email %>% 
  mutate(spam = as.factor(spam),
         to_multiple = as.factor(to_multiple),
         sent_email = as.factor(sent_email))

```
